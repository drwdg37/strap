Strap Sorting PWA (exported as individual files)
------------------------------------------------

If your app has trouble downloading ZIPs, download each file using the links shown in ChatGPT,
then recreate the same folder structure locally (keep file names and relative paths).

Key files:
- index.html
- manifest.json
- service-worker.js
- icons (PNG)

After copying to your web host (or a local static server), visit the site once,
then use "Add to Home Screen" on iPad.
